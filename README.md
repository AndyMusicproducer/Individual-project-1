# 29-SEPT-FIRST-MAIN-PROJECT# ðŸ§  Mental Health Awareness Website â€“ Project 4

## Project Overview

This is a responsive website designed to promote mental health awareness. It provides beginner-friendly information on common mental health issues, stress management tips, and links to external resourcesâ€”all presented in a calming, supportive layout.

The site is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**, with a focus on accessibility and clean design.

## Why I Chose This Project

I selected Project 4 because mental health is a vital topic that deserves more visibility and compassion. My goal is to create a welcoming space where users can explore helpful information and feel encouraged to take care of their mental well-being.

## Tools & Technologies

-   **HTML & CSS** â€“ For semantic structure and styling
-   **Bootstrap** â€“ To ensure responsive design and consistent layout
-   **Balsamiq** â€“ Used to wireframe the site across smartphone, tablet, and desktop views

## Wireframing

I used **Balsamiq Mockups** to create low-fidelity wireframes that illustrate the layout and user experience across devices. The wireframes include:

-   A **Hero Section** with positive messaging
-   **Information Cards** for mental health tips
-   A **Resource Links** grid with external support sites
-   A section for **Positive Affirmations** to uplift users

## ðŸ”— Research & Resources

To ensure the site provides accurate and helpful information, I researched reputable mental health websites and included links to the following:

-   [NHS Mental Health Services](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/)
-   [MentalHealth.gov](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/)
-   [Mind UK](https://www.mind.org.uk/)
-   [Here to Help](https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/)
-   [YoungMinds](https://www.youngminds.org.uk/)

These links are styled using Bootstrap buttons to make them visually distinct and easy to access.

## Future Improvements

-   Add interactive elements like a quote carousel
-   Include user-submitted affirmations or feedback
-   Explore accessibility enhancements using ARIA attributes
